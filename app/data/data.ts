export const aboutText = `
I’m a Full-Stack Software Developer with experience in building scalable web applications using FastAPI, Node.js, and React. I specialize in backend API development, data engineering workflows, and designing clean, responsive UIs.

My work spans cloud deployments (GCP, Docker), CI/CD, and developing modular, production-ready codebases. I’ve contributed to projects across asset management, survey tooling, and data auditing—bringing efficiency, speed, and clarity to engineering teams.

I hold a Master’s in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology and a Bachelor’s in Information Technology from Mumbai University. I thrive in fast-paced, remote-first environments, and enjoy working at the intersection of backend reliability and frontend usability.

Outside of work, I’m an avid chess player and enjoy working out regularly—it helps me stay disciplined, energized, and mentally sharp. I love contributing to mission-driven products, solving real-world problems, and writing clean, meaningful code.
